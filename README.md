## Overview

Welcome to the repository of the project "Development of a Diabetes Diagnosis Algorithm". This project was developed as part of the Introduction to Data Science course under the supervision of Professor Anthony Christidis. The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes using random forest algorithms.

## Features

### üîç Predictive Model Development

- **Random Forest Algorithms**: Implemented to develop a robust predictive model for diabetes diagnosis.
- **Variable Selection**: Conducted analysis to identify and select important variables affecting the diagnosis.

### üìâ Dimensionality Reduction

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, enhancing the model's performance.

### üõ† Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Hyperparameters Explored**: Focused on finding optimal values for `mtry` (number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split) and `min_n` (minimum size of terminal nodes) to improve model accuracy.

### üìä Visualization

- **Decision Tree Models**: Visualized decision trees to identify key variables significantly impacting the outcomes of diabetes diagnosis.
